rawWordList is a massive string taken from my excel spreadsheet list of japanese words

To update rawWordList,
1. download a .csv type excel spreadsheet with the following columns of data:
kanji,reading,politeform,meaning,meaning2,wordtype,note,learned,romaji,katakana,kanaOnly?
2. convert all newlines to \n's
3. paste in the word list into rawWordList
optional step 4: if a new data column was added, modify processWords()
The string is converted to a more digestible form (specifically, an array of word objects) by processWords() which is then placed in the variable wordList
